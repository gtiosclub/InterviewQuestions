# Brian's Big List of iOS Interview Shit

Welcome to Brian's Big List of iOS Interview Shit. Feel free to contribute and make a pull request. This is a very basic list without any explanations.

## Behavioral
  I feel like if interviewers were to interview you about iOS, they would ask more about your iOS Projects. Think about:
1. Something where you had to deal with performance in iOS (and how you would improve it)
2. Something where you had to deal with UI/UX in iOS (and how you would improve it)
3. Something particularly difficult in iOS that you had to deal with and how you solved it
4. Something that you’re proud of and how you implemented it (What, How, Impact)
5. How you would collaborate on iOS Projects (mention storyboard vs xibs vs code and modularity)
